## Bring your bookshelf with you

This is a bookshelf app to track what's on your shelves at home, in your audiobook library, who you lent that one book to, which books you've read, and which ones you want to read. 

As we progress further away from the world of the tangible, collecting eveything we want to in a single repository becomes impossible. The ritual of adding tomes to the shelf happens less and less as we listen to audiobooks, podcasts, and read on our screens.

This app aims to create a space where you can enjoy surveying the whole of your literary collection in one place.

This project was created to practice building MERN apps. MERN apps make use of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.JS. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Thanks

Thanks to Beau Carnes' MERN Tutorial which was referred to in creating this app.
